# Unhandled Exceptions in Next.js 15 App Router API Routes

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 App Router where exceptions thrown during asynchronous operations in API routes are not properly handled, potentially leading to silent failures or incomplete error responses.  The provided solution offers a robust approach for handling these exceptions.

## Problem

When an error occurs within an asynchronous function in an API route, the Next.js App Router may not provide a complete error response, making debugging challenging. The default error handling may be insufficient.

## Solution

Implement comprehensive error handling using try...catch blocks to intercept exceptions and return detailed error responses to the client.  This solution offers better control over error handling and enhances the overall user experience.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Make a request to `/api/data`. If the remote API is unavailable or returns an error, observe the response.

## Improvements

- Improved Error Handling
- Clear and concise error messages
- Enhanced debugging experience
